CheckBook 
By: Tyler Tscheulin
The project: 
  A virtual checkbook that allows the user to add or subtract money from their account.  
What:
  A very basic checkbook that uses buttons to add or subtract money from the userâ€™s account. 
Instructions:
  When the user loads up the application, the first window is the checkbook window. Here the user will be able to see any changes that have been done to their account. The very first time the user will need but their current balance in. 
  To do this and any other changes. The user will need to push the button that says Enter Amount. 
  There it will pop up a second window that will have an empty box that the user can input any number they want in it.
  Once the number is in the box then the user will need to push the Plus (Adding/Credit) symbol to add money into their account. 
  When the user wants to remove an amount from their account, they will just need to push the Minus (Subtracting/Debit) symbol and it will update the balance again on the front page. 
  If the user were to try to take out more than what they have in the account it will not allow them to do this. There will be an Error window letting the user know they do not have enough in the account. 
  When the user wants to exit the program all they need to do is click the exit button.
